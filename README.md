# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to map recent earthquake data, showcasing the level of magnitude through markes with different coloring and sizing. We also want to map tectonic plate data to understand the relationship between tectonic plate location and the earthquake data.

By creating different layerings on an HTML file, we can map this data and toggle the layers to showcase the specific data we want to see.

## Results

Our HTML has multiple layers showing the data we want, including a layer showing the tectonic plates, a layer showing all the earthquakes, and all the earthquakes above a 4.5 magnitude (Major Earthquakes). It also has different base layers with different features to provide alternative aesthetic features.
